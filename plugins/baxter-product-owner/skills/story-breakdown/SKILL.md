# Story Breakdown

Templates: `docs/templates/story.md`, `docs/templates/feature.md`

## Steps

1. Load parent Feature from ADO; load related Polarion requirements if IDs provided (`polarion-requirements-steward`)
2. Identify user-visible outcomes (not tasks)
3. For each story draft:
   - User story sentence (As a / I want / so that)
   - Given/When/Then AC (3–7 criteria typical)
   - Platform Decision and Rationale
   - Fibonacci estimate (1–20, one sprint)
   - Polarion requirement link(s)
4. Run **INVEST** check on each story
5. Flag enabler stories separately (same format, indirect value)
6. Ensure no story hides multi-sprint scope
