# Architectural Runway Review

Architectural Runway: `docs/futurestate-process.md`
SAFe Category Enabler: `docs/futurestate-process.md`

## Steps

1. Query Features/Stories for PI scope (`wit_query_by_wiql`)
2. Classify each item:
   - **Business Feature** — customer value
   - **Enabler Feature/Story** — runway, infra, compliance, exploration
   - **Mixed** — flag for split
3. Compute ratio: enabler SP / total SP (guideline: ART-specific; flag if enabler <10% when heavy tech debt reported, or >40% without business outcomes)
4. List **runway gaps** — upcoming business features lacking enabler predecessors
5. Cross-check Platform Decision Matrix — platform work should align to shared runway
6. Recommend enabler stories for next IP iteration or current PI

## Output
