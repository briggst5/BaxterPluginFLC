# Safe Process Navigator

## When to use

Process questions, ceremony prep, "what's our standard for X", tool routing.

## Steps

1. Read `docs/futurestate-process.md` for the answer
2. For DoR/DoD gates read `docs/dor-dod-checklists.md`
3. Use `docs/futurestate-process.md` and ADO wiki MCP for detail
4. Prefer live wiki via Azure DevOps MCP over stale local notes
5. If live wiki needed, use `wiki_get_page_content` (project: `FutureState`, wiki: Platform.wiki)
6. Route to a specialized skill when the user needs action, not explanation:

| Topic | Skill |
|-------|-------|
| Create/query ADO items | `ado-work-item-steward` |
| Requirements/Polarion | `polarion-requirements-steward` |
| PI planning prep | `pi-planning-prep` |
| Story writing | `acceptance-criteria-coach`, `story-breakdown` |
| Backlog hygiene | `backlog-readiness-audit` |
| Dependencies | `dependency-tracker` |


## DoR / DoD quick reference

**Story ready for sprint (DoR):** INVEST story, AC present, parent Feature, Platform Decision, sized ≤20 pts, no NeedsAC/NeedsPO tags

**Task ready (DoD defined):** "I know that I am done when…" list agreed, sized 1–3 pts, assigned to iteration

**Feature ready for PI:** Description, Technical Readiness, AC, sized for one PI, predecessors identified

## Output format

- Direct answer citing FutureState specifics (not generic SAFe)
- Link to wiki page path when helpful
- Suggest next skill if user should take action
