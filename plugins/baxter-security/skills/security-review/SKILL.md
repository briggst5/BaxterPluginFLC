# Security review

## When to use

Auth changes, new API endpoints, crypto, PII handling, or pre-release security checks.

## Checklist

1. Map trust boundaries and all external inputs.
2. Verify authn/authz on sensitive operations.
3. Scan for secrets in code, logs, and config.
4. Check injection, SSRF, path traversal, and unsafe deserialization (see `cwe-code-analysis`).
5. Flag new dependencies with known CVEs (`dependency-security-audit`, `sbom-cve-triage`).
6. For design-level gaps, sketch threats with `threat-model-sketch`.

## Output format

- **Risk**: low | medium | high
- **Findings**: numbered list with file/line references
- **Actions**: prioritized fixes
